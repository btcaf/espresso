# Espresso

A custom language interpreter created as an assignment for a course at MIMUW. The language is based off of the language described [here](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~ben/Zajecia/Mrj2022/Latte/). There are a few differences from the original:
* static typing has been introduced
* function definitions can be nested with static binding of identifiers
* `break` and `continue`
* tuples
* passing by value or reference

Examples of correct and incorrect programs can be found in the `good` and `bad` directories, respectively.
